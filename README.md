# The Social Chef

## Description

The Social Chef is a single page application built using react front end and ruby on rails backend that allows people to share and explore recipes. User can share their own recipe, look up others recipes and comment/rate those recipes. 

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql


## Setup

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the project template repository and removing
the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc — since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those files
on GitHub will cause issues.

[create repo]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line#adding-a-project-to-github-without-github-cli

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push
up your code:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

When you're ready to start building your project, run:

```sh
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```

You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3001]
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on [http://localhost:4000]

Make sure to also update this README to include documentation about
your project. Here's a list of some [awesome readmes][] for inspiration.

## Deploying

This application has all the starter code needed to help you deploy your
application to Heroku. 

If you've already set up your environment to deploy to Heroku, you can run the
commands below to deploy your application. If not, make sure to check out the
Environment Setup section below.

To deploy, first log in to your Heroku account using the Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku login
```

Create the new Heroku app:

```sh
heroku create my-app-name
```

Add the buildpacks for Heroku to build the React app on Node and run the Rails
app on Ruby:

```sh
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs --index 1
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby --index 2
```

To deploy, commit your code and push the changes to Heroku:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push heroku main
```

> Note: depending on your Git configuration, your default branch might be named
> `master` or `main`. You can verify which by running
> `git branch --show-current`. If it's `master`, you'll need to run
> `git push heroku master` instead.

Any time you have changes to deploy, just make sure your changes are committed
on the main branch of your repo, and push those changes to Heroku to deploy
them.

You can view your deployed app with:

```sh
heroku open
```
